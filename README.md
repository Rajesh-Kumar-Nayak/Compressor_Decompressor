Compressor_and_Decompressor
Synopsis of this Project:

This is a minor project on compressor and decompressor using Java language
The objective is to reduce the number of bits needed to represent data through compression technique
The project will only use lossless conversion to ensure no data loss occurs during compression
Benefits of compression include saving storage space, speeding up file transfers, and reducing storage hardware and network bandwidth costs
Lossless compression is essential to ensure data is not lost while compressing
